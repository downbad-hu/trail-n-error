   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Double-click on `PyDownloadManager.bat` to start the application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure Python is correctly installed and added to your PATH
2. Try running `install_vcredist.bat` to install required Visual C++ components
3. Check the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` file for more detailed solutions
