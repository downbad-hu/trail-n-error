# 🧪 Trial & Error Repository

A development sandbox of experimental, in-progress, and unreleased projects by **downbad-hu**.

This repository contains personal prototypes, dev utilities, concept tests, and tools not yet ready (or intended) for production. Shared as-is, for reference, inspiration, or further development.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This space serves as a public archive of ideas and technical exploration — things that were:
- Built quickly to test a concept
- Half-finished but interesting
- Not suitable for a standalone repo (yet)
- Meant to be learned from, broken, or improved

Some projects may evolve into full applications. Others are purely experimental.
